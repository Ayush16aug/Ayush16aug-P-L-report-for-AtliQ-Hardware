P&L reports for AtliQ Hardware using Excel and DAX, analyzing key financial metrics and showcasing significant year-over-year growth in Net Sales and Gross Margin. Explore my portfolio for details.



From 2019 to 2021, market performance demonstrated substantial revenue growth, with total sales increasing to $598.9 million from $87.5 million in 2019 and $196.7 million in 2020. This significant rise showcases the company's robust expansion and market penetration over these years. However, despite the impressive growth figures, all regions fell short of their 2021 targets, resulting in a combined shortfall of $54.9 million, or 9.2% below the projected figures.

Key markets like the USA, India, and Canada achieved high sales figures, with $87.8 million, $161.3 million, and $35.1 million, respectively. Despite these strong numbers, these regions did not meet their targets, indicating a gap between projected and actual performance. Notably, Canada underperformed by 14.5%, Poland by 18.1%, and Spain by 14.1%. These substantial gaps underscore the need for a more accurate market analysis and realistic target setting.

Several factors could contribute to these discrepancies, including market volatility, unforeseen economic conditions, and operational challenges. These shortfalls emphasize the necessity for improved strategic planning and execution. Future efforts should focus on enhancing market analysis, refining target-setting processes, and increasing operational efficiencies. 

By addressing these issues, the company can better align its expectations with achievable outcomes, ensuring more accurate forecasting and strategic alignment. This will be critical in maintaining robust growth while meeting targets in the future.
